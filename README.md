![I am Flutter Developer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devSouvik/devSouvik/master/gif3.gif)

My name is Oybek. My surname is Soliev. I am 20. I was born in 2001 in Fergana. I live in a small town of Tashkent in the Uzbekistan Republic. My address is Chilonzor 32, 27,  Small ring road Street. My phone number is +99899 806-14-24. I am a student. I study Amity University in Tashkent . I am a good student. I do well in all subjects. They say that I am a hard-working person. To tell the truth, all university subjects come easy to me but sometimes I have to work long hours, for example, to do lessons in
Network Basics or  Financial Accounting, to write a coding or to learn by heart. But my favourite subject is Data Structures Using C. I spend a lot of time on it reading books, to write  a coding etc.  I like reading. I think comics and detective stories are much easier to read but I prefer to read novels - historical or modern. I like music. My musical tastes are different, it depends on my mood. But I think every apple is good in its season. 
I play the football and volleyball, not seriously but for my soul. Sometimes I like to listen to Turk music.  I don't have much time to watch TV but sometimes I spend an hour or two watching an interesting film or a news programme. In the evening I often read newspapers (our local ones) or magazines. I like fresh air and exercise. I wish I had more time for doing sports. But some aerobics in the morning, a swimming pool twice a week day are of great help. Sport is fun. I have a wide circle of interests. I'm very sociable, so I get on very well with people. I have many friends, most of them are my classmates.  But most of all I like my family. We all are great friends and deeply attached to each other. That's all about me - a person with her good and not very good traits of character, liking this and hating that. But it's interesting for me to live and to open new things.
